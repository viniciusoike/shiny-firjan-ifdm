# Dashboard IFDM

This repository hosts a dashboard that visualizes human development indicators across all cities in Brazil. The data is provided from Firjan's City Development Indicators (IFDM). The IFDM is similar to the popular Human Development Index from the UN; its main advantage is the temporal horizonte, which spans from 2005 to 2016 whereas UN data is available only for 2010.
